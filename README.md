Building a Password Strength Classifier Model Using Machine Learning
Password strength is used to measure how effective a password is against external attacks. External attacks are in form of password cracking or brute-force attacks. They aim to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network.
The strength of a password is usually measured using its complexity, length, and unpredictability.
Cyber crimes and data breaches are on the rise, and the main cause for this is usually compromised passwords.
